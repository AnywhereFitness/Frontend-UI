        <h2> - Our Story - </h2>
            <p>Anywhere Fitness was devoloped by a group of Lambda Students for a group project. Each student is from a different discipline and different place in the program. Some may be freshman (first few months in the program) and others are seniors, with everything inbetween. The disciplines involved in creating this incredible application are Full Stack Web Development, IOS, and UX design. Our project lead is Diante Lewis. Our Web UI designers are Marvin Lewis and Tyler De Friess. Our UX designer is Michelle Honig. Our Web React 1 architects are Andrea Harris and Michael Famurewa. Our Web React 2 architects are Jordon Covo and Krishna Dahal. Our backend devoloper is DeAndre Johnson. Finally our IOS engineer is Brian Vilchez. Each member dedicated a special characteristic to this application and without none of this would be possible!
